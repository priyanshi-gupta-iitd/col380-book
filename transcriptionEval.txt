1) Accuracy: 
    • Correct words, meaning, and technical intent preserved.
    • No missing key claims.
    • Numbers, symbols, variable names, code tokens, and terminology are correct.
    
2) Completeness and coverage
    • Entire assigned segment transcribed.
    • Important asides captured when they affect understanding (assumptions, exceptions, such as “common pitfall”, etc.).
   
3) Technical correctness of notation and math
   • Explanations are added as necessary

4) Code and command transcription quality
    • Code blocks are exact and runnable (when intended).
    • Correct indentation, punctuation, with syntax highlighting include headers, pragmas, MPI/OpenMP calls.
    • Commands and flags accurate (-O3 vs -03, mpicc vs mpic).

5) Structure and readability for a book manuscript: you aren’t writing the book, but your output should be “editor-ready.”
    • Clear paragraphs; appropriate line breaks.
    • Headings inserted where obvious (topic shifts), without rewriting content.
    • Lists formatted consistently.
    • Speaker disfluencies handled per policy (see below).

6) Reference alignment (slides/board/figures)
    • Marks transitions appropriately in the content (either as a para, subsection or section)
    • figures are introduced as necessary
    • Notes are added where a figure is required for comprehension
    • hyper-refs and citations are added as necessary
